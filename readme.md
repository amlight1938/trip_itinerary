## About This Website

Taking the form of a professional tour guide company's website, this project is a digital journal of vacations, day trips, or adventurous activities that I have done in the past. Every trip, sample itinerary, and photo is from my own past experiences. Hopefully this journal will inspire future adventures for its users!


## Features of this website

- React JS frontend communicates with Ruby on Rails backend API
- RESTful web application utilizes CRUD (create, read, update, destroy) operations between frontend and backend API
- Implements SQL on relational database with associations between users, trips, activities, itineraries, and images
- Users can securely create accounts, login, and create, update, or delete custom trips using -Bcrypt (password salting and hashing library)
